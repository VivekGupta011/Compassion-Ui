    question: "I’m convinced – what should I do next?",
    answer:
      "Our Legacies team (giftsinwill@compassionuk.org) can answer any questions you have and they’re also the team to tell once you’ve made a legacy pledge in your Will.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much should I leave Compassion?",
    answer:
      "This is entirely up to you! Of course, you’ll first want to make provision for your family and that should be your priority. But after you’ve taken care of your loved ones, please prayerfully consider leaving a gift to Compassion and, indeed, other causes you are passionate about. A couple of things that might help your planning: please consider leaving a percentage of your estate, rather than a fixed amount, in your Will. It provides much more flexibility for whatever happens to your financial circumstances in the future, and even small amounts such as 1% or 2% can make an enormous difference. Plus there might be inheritance tax benefits to donating to charity in your Will which you may want to take financial advice about.",
  },
  {
    question: "How will Compassion steward my gift in Will?",
    answer:
      "As we’ve carefully stewarded your sponsorship donations over many years, we will also steward your legacy gift. Our administration and fundraising costs are amongst the lowest in the charity sector, ensuring most of your donations reach children who need them.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "How will Compassion use my will to support my sponsored children?",
    answer:
      "If you choose, Compassion can use your gift to support any children you sponsor until they complete their time in the Compassion programme. We’ll even find someone else to write letters and pray for them. To make this happen, please contact us after you’ve set up your Will, and we’ll mark your intention on your supporter record. We promise to do this even if the amount Compassion receives in your Will ends up being less than the costs of supporting your sponsored child in the programme over multiple years. And, of course, any extra money will be passed on as a blessing to other children in poverty.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I name my sponsored child/children in my Will?",
    answer:
      "We kindly request that you name Compassion UK instead of specifying individual sponsored children in your Will, as circumstances may change for the child or children you currently support. We commit to ensuring your child will be supported throughout the programme using your legacy gift. If you have any questions about how to sign up to leave a gift in your Will, please contact giftsinwill@compassionuk.org and the team will be very happy to help you.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Should I tell you if I’m leaving a gift to Compassion in my Will?",
    answer:
      "We would be delighted to know if you plan to leave us a gift in your Will, and we will update your supporter record to reflect this. We’ll also add you to the special communications we have with people who’ve chosen to leave legacy gifts, plus we’ll make sure you stop getting asked to leave a legacy in the future! Just let giftsinwill@compassionuk.org know that you’ve left a legacy to Compassion and the team will do the rest. Knowing about future legacy pledges is extremely helpful for Compassion to decide how we spend our limited marketing budgets. We might contact you to learn which of our promotions are working so we can steward our advertising budgets more carefully in future and prioritise those activities with the best response rates.",
